        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Hey whats up everyone. My name is Peeta Mellark. I'm 
            from District 12. I enjoy baking, working out, and spending time with my wife, Katniss.
        </p>
        <p>
            Years ago, I participated in the Hunger Games, where I was crowned the 74th winner, along with my wife. 
            After that, I participated in the 75th Hunger Games, as well as fought for the Revolutionaries in the following Civil War.

        <h3><i>Hunger Games</i></h3>
        <p>
            Many years ago, I participated in the Hunger Games not once, but twice.
            By using my artistic skills from being a baker, as well as my strength from lifting heavy bags of flour each day,
             I was able to survive both ordeals. Each time, I had been close to death, but through Katniss's help and sheer willpower, I was able to survive.
        </p>
        <h3><i>Civil War</i></h3>
        <p>
            In the Civil war, I had fought with the Revolutionaries. However, because I was traumatized from the Hunger Games, as well as torchered by the Capital, 
            I was not able to help out as much as I had wished to. After the war, I served a seat in the Government Senate for a bit, before living a quiet life on the outcrops of Panem.
        </p>
        <h3><i>Life at Lehigh</i></h3>
        <p>
            I came to Lehigh to further my education, and use it to improve my baking process and machinery in the future.
